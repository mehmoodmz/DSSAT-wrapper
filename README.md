# DSSAT-wrapper

This repos. aims to provide a DSSAT crop model wrapper for the CroptimizR package.

It is an evolution of the one created for AgMIP Calibration Phase III protocol (see https://github.com/sbuis/AgMIP-Calibration-Phase-III).

This new version of the wrapper aims to be more generic and efficient than the first version (e.g. work with any type of observed variable, with multiple experiment files, ...).
